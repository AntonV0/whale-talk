# Whale Talk
## Project #29 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
Whale Talk is a sophisticated JavaScript program that translates input strings into something a real whale would say. There's a few things to note about whale language:
- Whales do not use consonants, only vowels (excluding "y")
- The "u"s and "e"s are extra long, so the program doubles these vowels
- The whale output must be sung slowly, as is the custom in the ocean 
## What I Learned
  - How to speak Whalesh
  - Using an empty array to store vowels from an input string
  - Using for loops to iterate through each input letter, using the push() method when the input letter is a vowel
